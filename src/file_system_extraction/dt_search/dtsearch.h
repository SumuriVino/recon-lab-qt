     Summary
     Preserve existing <link Document Ids, document ids> following a compression of an
     index or a merge of two or more indexes.
     Remarks
     Each document in an index is assigned a unique integer identifier called a
     document id or "DocId". The first document added to an index has the DocId 1, and
     subsequent documents will have sequentially numbered DocIds 2, 3, 4, and so
     forth. When a document is reindexed, its DocId is "cancelled" and a new DocId is
     assigned.

     When an index is compressed, all DocIds in the index are renumbered to remove the
     cancelled DocIds unless the dtsIndexKeepExistingDocIds flag is set in IndexJob.

     When an index is merged into another index, DocIds in the target index are never
     changed. The documents merged into the target index will all be assigned new,
     sequentially-numbered DocIds, unless (a) the dtsIndexKeepExistingDocIds flag is
     set in IndexJob and (b) the indexes have non-overlapping ranges of doc ids.

     If the dtsIndexKeepExistingDocIds is set in a merge and one or more indexes have
     overlapping doc ids, the error dtsErConflictingDocIdRanges will be returned and
     the merge will halt.

     When an index is created, you can specify a starting DocId other than 1 using
     IndexJob.StartingDocId. This makes it possible to ensure that indexes have
     non-overlapping ranges of DocIds so DocIds can be preserved after the indexes are
     merged.

                                                                                       */

/* Summary
   Control indexing of meta-data associated with documents
   Remarks
   FieldFlags provide options to control the indexing of meta-data associated with
   documents. When highlighting hits, it is important to make sure that FieldFlags
   has the same options that were used when a document was indexed. Otherwise, hit
   highlighting may be incorrect due to differences in the words found in each
   document.

   By default, dtSearch will index fields in documents such as the Summary
   Information fields in Word files and META tags in HTML files. FieldFlags can be
   used to suppress some or all of this metadata.

   dtSearch will also add a "Filename" field to the end of each document, with the
   full path and filename of the document, so words in the document name will be
   searchable like other text. To suppress this completely, use
   dtsoFfSkipFilenameField. To include only the name of the document (not the path),
   use dtsoSkipFilenameFieldPath.

   The dtsoFfHtmlShow* flags can be used to make normally hidden HTML elements, such
   as styles or links, visible and searchable. For each category of element that is
   enabled, a section will be added to the end of the HTML file listing the items in
   that category. For example, if dtsoFfHtmlShowComments is set, then each HTML file
   will have a list of the embedded comments after the body of the HTML.

     names of the files inside the archive.

     "secret2.doc", and "secret3.doc", all stored in the ZIP file with encryption. The

       In some cases, such as forensic or E-discovery searching, users want to search across all text

/* Summary
   Used with dtsIndexJob and dtsSearchJob to record errors that occur during
   indexing or searching.
   Remarks
   dtsErrorInfo accumulates messages in a buffer and has member functions to provide
   access to those messages. Additionally, it has a callback function you can use to
   \obtain notifications each time a message is added to the dtsErrorInfo.
   dtsErrorInfo provides a more thread-friendly way to report errors than the global
   callback functions in the dtsInitInfo structure passed to dtssDoInit.

   For each message, the following information is recorded: (1) a numeric code,
   which identifies the message in a language-independent way; (2) the text of the
   message; and (3) up to two string arguments for the message. For example, if an
   index cannot be accessed in a search, the numeric code will be dtsErAccIndex, the
   text of the message will be "Unable to access index," the first argument will be
   the path to the index, and the second argument will be the reason the index could
   not be accessed.

   To use dtsErrorInfo,

     1. Declare a dtsErrorInfo struct with the buffer size you want. (The
        constructor lets you specify the maximum number of messages and the total size of
        the string buffer.)
     2. Attach the dtsErrorInfo to the dtsSearchJob or dtsIndexJob as its
        errorHandler member.
     3. If you want to receive notifications when an error occurs, use the
        dtsErrorInfo's pNotifyFn member to designate the function to be called.
     4. Execute the dtsSearchJob or dtsIndexJob.
     5. After the job is complete, use the member functions described below to
        access information on the error conditions that occurred during the search.
     6. The dtsErrorInfo destructor will automatically delete the memory buffers
        allocated for the dtsErrorInfo. For information on error codes generated by the
        dtSearch Engine, see "Error Codes."

   The data members of dtsErrorInfo (messageText, messageCode, etc.) should not be
   accessed directly. Instead, use the dtsErrorInfo constructor to initialize them
   and then use getCount(), getMessage(), etc. to access them.                            */

/* Summary
   Used to modify words, or create additional words, as text is indexed.
   Remarks
   The dtsOnIndexWordInfo structure is used with the pOnIndexWordFn callback in
   dtsIndexJob to provide a way to modify the words in a document as they are being
   indexed. Some possible uses of this callback include: (1) Customizing the
   character handling for certain characters; (2) Excluding certain words from being
   indexed; or (3) adding variations on a word.

   \Example (from the textdemo sample application):

   <code>
   // Demonstrates how the OnIndexWord callback function can be used to
   // modify text being indexed. In this case, each word is indexed along with an
   // inverted version of the word.
   void OnIndexWord_Inverter(void *pData, dtsOnIndexWordInfo* pInfo)
   {   // First time we are called for a word, just request another callback
       if (pInfo-\>iWhichCallback == 0) {
           pInfo-\>nAdditionalWords = 1;
           return;
           }

       // Second time we are called for a word, return the inverted version
       if (pInfo-\>iWhichCallback == 1) {
           int l = strlen(pInfo-\>originalWord);
           if (l \>= sizeof pInfo-\>wordToIndex)
               l = sizeof pInfo-\>wordToIndex-1;
           for (int i = 0; i \< l; ++i)
               pInfo-\>wordToIndex[i] = pInfo-\>originalWord[l-i-1];
           pInfo-\>wordToIndex[l] = '0';
           }

    /* Summary
       If non-zero, the first doc id to assign to documents in this index.
       Remarks
       By default, the dtSearch indexer assigns each document a numerical id starting
       with 1 in each index. These ids are used in SearchFilters and in other places in
       the dtSearch Engine API to identify documents within an index. When an index is
       created, startingDocId can be used to specify that doc ids for the index should
       start with a value other than 1. This can be useful in situations where it is
       important that doc ids not change when indexes are merged.

       Each DocId value in an index requires one bit in a SearchFilter, so a
       SearchFilter for an index with DocIds ranging from 1 to 1,000,000 would require
       125,000 bytes of memory. Note that this means there is a performance cost to
       using unnecessarily high values for startingDocId.

/* Summary
   Define a search to be performed.
   Remarks
   A dtsSearchJob is used in the dtssDoSearchJob function call to define a search to
   be performed
   * Search criteria *
   There are three components to the <link Search Requests Overview, search request>
   that can be included in a dtsSearchJob:

   (1) request2: The search request, which can be in the "<link Boolean Search Requests, boolean>",
   "all words", or "anywords" syntax, depending on the value of searchFlags2.

   (2) booleanConditions: A string in the boolean syntax expressing any conditions
   that must be satisfied in addition to whatever is in request2. This provides a
   way to add boolean conditions (such as field criteria) to a user-supplied query,
   which may be in the all words or any words syntax.

   (3) fileConditions2: A string expressing conditions such as filename matches,
   \file size matches, etc., that documents must satisfy. See <link File Conditions, FileConditions>
   for the syntax.
   * Search results *
   Search results are obtained using a search results object. To set up a search
   job, declare a dtsSearchResults object to hold the results and then attach its
   handle to dtsSearchResults.resultsHandle. After the search, you can use the
   dtsSearchResults object to access the results of the search.
   Example
   <code>
           dtsSearchResults searchResults;
           dtsSearchJob searchJob;
           // ... set up searchJob ...
           searchJob.resultsHandle = searchResults.getHandle();
           \short errorFlag;
           dtssDoSearchJob(searchJob, errorFlag);
           // .. now searchResults contains the results of the search
   </code>
   * Search filters *
   A search filter represents a set of documents that can be returned in a search.
   To limit a search to the documents in a search filter, set up a dtsSearchFilter
   \object with the filter to use, and set dtsSearchResults.searchFilterHandle to
   the handled returned by dtsSearchFilter.getHandle(). Example:

   <code>
           dtsSearchFilter searchFilter;
           // ... read searchFilter from disk, or generate it by searching, or set allowed values
           // directly using searchFilter.selectItems() ...
           dtsSearchJob searchJob;
           // ... set up searchJob ...
           searchJob.searchFilterHandle = searchFilter.getHandle();
           // Now when searchJob is executed, only documents identified by searchFilter can be
           // retrieved.
   </code>

   To generate a search filter based on the results of a search, set the
   \outputSearchFilterHandle to the handle of a dtsSearchFilter. Every document

       results (dtsSearchResults) that can be returned after a search. The most relevant
       documents from all matching documents in the index will be included in search
       results.

       Regardless of the maxFilesToRetrieve2 setting, totalFiles will return the a count
       that includes <i>all</i> matching documents. maxFilesToRetrieve2 limits the
       number of items saved in the returned dtsSearchResults, but it does not stop the
       search before all matching documents have been identified.

       For example, if you set maxFilesToRetrieve=10 and autoStopLimit=5000, then search
       results will contain the 10 most relevant documents from the first 5000 found.
       Documents after the first 5000 found will not be considered, because
       autoStopLimit=5000 will force the search to halt after 5000 matching documents
       are found.

       If the dtsSearchSelectMostRecent flag is set in searchFlags2, the most <i>recent</i>

    Summary:

    Use to replace the default connectors used in search requests.

    Remarks:

    The BooleanConnectors option setting lets you change the connectors that
    dtSearch uses in boolean searches (and, or, not, etc.)

    The default connectors are: AND, OR, NOT, W/, CONTAINS, and TO.

    To replace the default connectors with alternative connectors (i.e., in
    French) set BooleanConnectors to a series of items each of which consists of
    a connector string and the equivalent English connector, in this format:
    <code>
    {new connector=connector name}
    </code>

    For example:

    <code>
    {et=and} {ou=or} {sauf=not} {m/=w/} {contient=contains} {and=and} {or=or}
    {not=not} {contains=contains} {w/=w/} {to=to}
    </code>

    The standard English connectors are included as well as the French
    connectors in this example. If BooleanConnectors is not blank, the
    connectors it defines will replace the defaults, so dtSearch will not
    recognize and, or, not, etc. To restore the default English connectors, add
    an item for each connector to the list, as in the above example. It is
    possible to have more than one way of expressing each type of connector so,
    for example, "and" or "et" both are equivalent to the default "AND"
    connector.

    Text in connectors must consist entirely of searchable letters. Punctuation
    characters that are not searchable letters cannot be used as part of a
    connector. The only exception to this rule is the w/N syntax for proximity
    searches, which allows w/ to be redefined as any single letter (a-z only)
    followed by a /.

    Summary:

    Use to replace the default connectors used in search requests.

    Remarks:

    The BooleanConnectors option setting lets you change the connectors that
    dtSearch uses in boolean searches (and, or, not, etc.)

    The default connectors are: AND, OR, NOT, W/, CONTAINS, and TO.

    To replace the default connectors with alternative connectors (i.e., in
    French) set BooleanConnectors to a series of items each of which consists of
    a connector string and the equivalent English connector, in this format:
    <code>
    {new connector=connector name}
    </code>

    For example:

    <code>
    {et=and} {ou=or} {sauf=not} {m/=w/} {contient=contains} {and=and} {or=or}
    {not=not} {contains=contains} {w/=w/} {to=to}
    </code>

    The standard English connectors are included as well as the French
    connectors in this example. If BooleanConnectors is not blank, the
    connectors it defines will replace the defaults, so dtSearch will not
    recognize and, or, not, etc. To restore the default English connectors, add
    an item for each connector to the list, as in the above example. It is
    possible to have more than one way of expressing each type of connector so,
    for example = "and" or "et" both are equivalent to the default "AND"
    connector.

    Text in connectors must consist entirely of searchable letters. Punctuation
    characters that are not searchable letters cannot be used as part of a
    connector. The only exception to this rule is the w/N syntax for proximity
    searches, which allows w/ to be redefined as any single letter (a-z only)
    followed by a /.

       saved as "sample.exe.data". allowedExtensions is a null-delimited string set.

/* Summary
   Describes how you want a dtSearch search report to be generated.
   Remarks
   dtsOutputInfo provides ways to control the format (HTML, RTF, plain text) and
   appearance of the output (file format, headers, footers, etc.) as well as the
   manner in which the output is provided (in memory, to a file, or through a
   callback function).

   The header, footer, beforeHit, and afterHit markings should be in the format of
   the output. For example, if the output format is HTML, then beforeHit and
   afterHit markings could be \<b\> and \</b\>.

   beforeHit, afterHit, header, and footer control the appearance of converted text.

   The header and footer strings are inserted before and after the body of the
   document.

   The beforeHit and afterHit markers are inserted before and after each hit word.
   The beforeHit and afterHit markers can contain hypertext links.

   To facilitate creation of hit navigation markers, the strings "%%ThisHit%%",
   "%%NextHit%%", and "%%PrevHit%%" will be replaced with ordinals representing the
   current hit, the next hit, and the previous hit in the document.

   For example, the following code makes the beforeHit and nextHit marks act as HTML
   "Previous Hit" and "Next Hit" buttons.
   <code>
       job.beforeHit =
                    "\<A NAME="hit%%ThisHit%%"\>"

   * Format *
   A search report lists the hits found in one or more documents, with each hit
   surrounded by a specified amount of context. Each block of context starts with a
   contextHeader and ends with the contextFooter. Contiguous or overlapping blocks
   \of context will be combined. The amount of context included in the report can be
   specified by words or by paragraphs.

   Each block of context is constructed as follows:
   <code>
       [ContextHeader]
       ...text... [BeforeHit] hit [AfterHit] ...text...
       [ContextFooter]
   </code>

Summary:
Used by dtssConvertPath2 to convert among virtual, local, and UNC paths

Remarks:

Internet Information Server stores its mapping between virtual and local paths
in the Metabase. Reading this information from the Metabase is time-consuming
and requires access rights that may not be available to a process running in the
web server context. Therefore, the dtSearch Engine caches this information in
the registry, under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\dtSearch
Corp.\dtSearch\Virtual Roots. By default, the conversion will use the cached table
values. Call ConvertPath with the dtsCpRefreshMappings + dtsCpStoreInRegistry
flags to update the cached information. (Running dtWebSetup.exe, the dtSearch
Web Setup program, will also update this information.)

If path conversion returns a blank string, it means that either (1) the folder
passed in does not have a virtual directory associated with it, or (2) the
registry tables have not been refreshed since the virtual directory was created.

Summary:
Used to install a crash handler so a stack trace can be recorded in the event of an unhandled exception

Remarks:
The functions to install and remove the crash handler are:
    void dtssInstallCrashDiagnostics(dtsCrashHandlerInfo& info)
    void dtssRemoveCrashDiagnostics()

The stack trace file will list each item on the stack as an address.  A utility
included with the dtSearch Engine, StackTrace.exe, can be used to convert these
addresses to symbol names.  To use StackTrace.exe, you will need a .map file for
your program.   For example, if your program is MySearch.exe, you will need a
map file named MySearch.map.  The Visual C++ linker does not generate map files
by default so you will need to enable this option to get a map file.  Also, the
map file is only valid for the particular build for which it was generated.  If
you modify and rebuild the program, a new map file will be needed.  Once you
have a map file and the text file created by dtssInstallCrashDiagnostics, you
can get the symbols as follows:
<code>
    StackTrace MySearch.map Error.txt > ErrorWithSymbols.txt
</code>
If your program includes multiple modules, you can list the map files for each
module before the error file, like this:
<code>
    StackTrace MySearch.map MyAdditionalDll.map Error.txt > ErrorWithSymbols.txt
</code>

/* Summary
   Provides access to the results of a search.
   Remarks
   A handle managed by the dtSearch Engine represents the search results, and
   dtsSearchResults calls dtSearch Engine API functions to obtain information using
   the handle and, in the destructor, to destroy the object represented by the
   handle.
   Example
   The following code sequence demonstrates the use of dtsSearchResults:
   <code>
       dtsSearchResults results;

       // Attach the dtsSearchResults object to the dtsSearchJob
       dtsSearchJob searchJob;
       searchJob.resultsHandle = results.getHandle();

       // Execute the search
       ... set up rest of searchJob ...
       \short errFlag;
       dtssDoSearchJob(searchJob, errFlag);
   </code>                                                                          */

/* Summary
   Used to efficiently limit the results of a search to a specified subset of one or
   more indexes.
   Remarks
   * Overview *
   The dtsSearchFilter class provides a way to designate which documents can be
   returned by a search. It is useful in situations where a text search using must
   be combined with a search of a database. The database search is done first, and
   then the results of the database search are used to limit the dtSearch search.

   To use a search filter to limit a search,
     1. Create the search filter, or read a previously-create search filter from a
        disk file.
     2. Attach the search filter to a dtsSearchJob's searchFilterHandle
   * Document Ids *
   Search filters do not use names to identify documents because a filter may
   specify thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of documents, and a table of
   filenames would take too much memory and would take too long to check. Instead,
   each document is identified by (a) the index it belongs to, and (b) the
   document's document id, or docId, a unique integer that is assigned to each
   document in an index. The docId for a document can be obtained by searching for
   the document by name, and then examining the document's properties in search
   results. In the C++ API, the docId is returned as dtsSearchResultsItem.docId.
   See: <link Document Ids>

   The first document added to an index has the DocId 1, and subsequent documents
   will have sequentially numbered DocIds 2, 3, 4, and so forth. When a document is
   reindexed, its docId is "cancelled" and a new docId is assigned. Compressing an
   index renumbers all of the docIds, so after an index has been compressed, a
   document's docId may change.

   A docId that is selected may be returned in search results. A document that is
   not selected will not be returned in search results, even if it otherwise
   satisfies the search request.

   If the criteria for the search filter can be expressed as one or more search
   requests, you can use selectItemsBySearch to select documents in the
   SearchFilter.
   * Indexes and Index identifiers *
   A search filter can cover any number of indexes. To add an index to a search
   filter, call addIndex() with the full path to the index. The path must be
   expressed exactly as it will be expressed in the search job. The addIndex()
   function returns an integer that is used to identify that index when selecting
   and de-selecting documents for the filter. (This makes the selection and
   de-selection functions, which may be called thousands of times, more effiicent.)
   * Implementation *
   A search filter is implemented in the dtSearch Engine using a table of bit
   vectors, one for each index in the filter. Each bit vector has one bit for each
   document in its index. For example, a search filter for a single index with
   1,000,000 documents would have 1,000,000 bits, or 125 kilobytes of data. The
   write function compresses the bit vector where possible, so a saved search filter
   may be smaller than the bit vectors that it contains.

   When a search filter is created, the dtSearch Engine returns a handle to it. The
   dtsSearchFilter class wraps this handle.
   * Example *
   The following code sequence demonstrates the use of dtsSearchFilter to limit a
   search:
   <code>
       dtsSearchJob searchJob;
        ... set up search job ...
         // Set up a filter that will only allow documents 1 through 10 in the index
        // to be returned.
        dtsSearchFilter filter;
        int iIndex = filter.addIndex("c:\\data\\index");
        filter.selectItems(iIndex, 1, 10, true);

        // Attach the search filter to the search job
        searchJob.searchFilterHandle = filter.getHandle();

        // Execute the search
       \short errFlag;
       dtssDoSearchJob(searchJob, errFlag);
   </code>                                                                           */
